# Jargons in Microbiome related articles, reviews and books
This is a list of jargons I need to break down to understand the concepts. Feel free to pull requests or add discussions

### **Microbiome**

The collection of all microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, viruses, archaea etc.) in a given environment.

*Used interchangeably as microbes, microbiota*

---

### **Sample**

A single unit of data collection, representing an individual or environmental site, from which microbiome data is collected.

- A sample is what you study to understand a population. For example, a stool sample from a person can be analyzed to study gut microbiota.

---

### **Population**

The entire group from which samples are drawn, often representing a larger ecosystem or group of individuals.

- If you study gut microbiota across 100 people, all those individuals together make up the population.

---

### **Count Data**

Data representing the number of occurrences of specific microbial taxa in a sample.

- If you analyze a stool sample, you might count how many bacteria of each type (e.g., *E. coli*, *Bacteroides*) are present.

---

### **Compositional Data**

Data where the total sum of all values is constant (e.g., percentages or proportions), often used in microbiome studies due to relative abundances.

- Instead of raw counts, microbiome data is often shown as proportions. For example, *E. coli* might make up 30% of the bacteria in a sample.

---

### **Within Samples of Same Population**

Comparison or analysis of data between different samples taken from the same population.

- Comparing stool samples from multiple people within the same community to see if their microbiomes are similar.

---

### **Between Populations**

Comparison of data between two or more distinct groups or populations.

- Comparing the gut microbiomes of people from two different countries.

---

### **Mean**

The average value; the sum of values divided by the number of values.

- If three people have 10, 20, and 30 *E. coli*, the mean abundance is (10+20+30)/3=20.

(10+20+30)/3=20(10+20+30)/3 = 20

*Various types of mean calculations are made when normalizing the data or comparing the differences between populations.* 

---

### **Median**

The middle value in a sorted dataset.

- If three samples have 5%, 10%, and 15% of a bacterium, the median is 10%.

*Helpful in seeing how the data is distributed, are the values similar between samples are differing too much.*

---

### **Mode**

The value that appears most frequently in the data.

- If bacterial abundances are 5%, 5%, and 10%, the mode is 5%.

---

### **Variance**

A measure of how much values in a dataset vary from the mean.

- If one sample has 10% of a bacterium and another has 90%, the variance is high.

---

### **Covariance**

A measure of how two variables change together.

- If an increase in one bacterium correlates with a decrease in another, covariance can describe this relationship.

---

### **Standard Deviation**

The square root of variance, indicating the average distance from the mean.

- If the standard deviation of bacterial abundance is small, most samples are similar.

---

### **Range**

The difference between the maximum and minimum values.

- If bacterial abundances range from 5% to 95%, the range is 95%−5%=90%.

95%−5%=90%95\% - 5\% = 90\%

---

### **Hypothesis**

A testable statement or prediction about a phenomenon.

- Hypothesis: "People who eat more fiber have a higher abundance of *Bifidobacteria* in their gut microbiome."

---

### **Validation**

Confirming that a hypothesis or model holds true across different datasets.

- Testing the fiber-*Bifidobacteria* relationship in multiple studies to ensure it's consistent.

---

### **Abundance**

The total count or proportion of a microbial taxon in a sample.

- A sample may contain 1,000 *E. coli* cells.

*Term used in metagenomics - amplicon or shotgun*

---

### **Expression**

The activity level or gene expression of microbes.

- Measuring how much a specific microbial gene is being used in the gut.

*Term used in metatranscriptomics, RNA-Seq*

---

### **Matrix**

A table organizing data, often with rows as samples and columns as microbial taxa.

- A matrix might show bacterial abundances across 10 samples.

---

### **Relative Abundance**

The proportion of a specific taxon relative to the total microbial community.

- If a sample has 100 bacteria and 25 are *E. coli*, its relative abundance is 25/100=25%.

---

### **Observed Abundance**

The actual count or measure of a specific taxon in a sample.

- The exact number of *E. coli* cells in a stool sample (e.g., 1,000).

---

### **Total Abundance**

The sum of all microbial counts in a sample.

- If a sample contains 10,000 bacteria in total, that's the total abundance.
